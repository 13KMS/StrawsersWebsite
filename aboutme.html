We felt the remnants of the evening heat. Said Harvey let me be the one to say. I wouldn't dream this any other way. Harvey. Nobody knows what I see. Nobody knows I'm waiting. Waiting for you to call. Harvey. Nobody knows what I see. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Crazy for you, oh boy. Harvey. Nobody knows what I see. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Crazy for you, oh boy. Harvey.

Hello, there! ⤷ ゛🦈ˎˊ˗
</p>
<p>
My name is Kalista, you can just call me Kali if you like.
</p>
<p>
I love reading, writing, and drawing. I have always been in love with the arts and hope to spread that creativity and imagination to others.
</p>
<p>
I've taken classes of Graphic Design, Photography, Ceramics, 3D Design, and now Web Design which I'm hoping to master as well. I want to show my work and how I can bring a new set of ideas and a fresh mind.
</p>
<p>
My parents and friends are my heros and close family. I have a female dog who's a Pitbull, her name is Luna; she's just so sweet and cute! I love to play video games like "The Last Of Us", "Fallout 4", "Ender Lilies", and "Stray".
</p>
<p>
Indie, Alternative, and Rock are my favorite music genres but I also love to play Indie games as they have some of the best works. I wish to be a Video Game Designer when I grow up.

	<p>I plan on getting into Penn. State or Cal. Arts for college/university, after I graduate from highschool and get my general studies done at Mira Coasta Community College.</p>
	<p>I like cozy, inspiring spaces where I can create a room filled with art supplies, some plants, and my favorite music playing in the background. While I enjoy collaborating with others creatively, and working with a team that blends art, storytelling, and tech.</p>
	<p>I have a close-knit group of friends who are also into creative things, and love sharing ideas and collaborating with me. I have a ritual for starting new projects, like looking at references, putting on certain music, and doodling to warm up my brain.</p>
	<p>I get really into world-building when I write about backstories, culture, and settings in detail. Cause of this I sometimes lose track of time when I'm deep in my art or gaming.</p>
